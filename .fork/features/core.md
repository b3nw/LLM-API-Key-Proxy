Target: `feat(core): infrastructure improvements - latest aliases, error standardization, and utilities`
Files:

- `src/rotator_library/client/executor.py`

Verification:
- `uv run python3 -m py_compile src/rotator_library/client/streaming.py` — passed
- `uv run python3 -m py_compile src/rotator_library/client/executor.py` — passed
- `uv run ruff check src/rotator_library/client/streaming.py --select F401,F811,F821,E9` — passed
- `uv run ruff check src/rotator_library/client/executor.py --select F401,F811,F821,E9` — passed
- Live streaming test (umans/kimi-k2.6, max_tokens=300): reasoning properly captured, content clean
- Live streaming test (umans/kimi-k2.6, max_tokens=4096): full reasoning separated, haiku content only
- Live non-streaming test: reasoning extracted via regex, content clean
- Non-kimi model (mistral): unaffected, no false reasoning detection

Notes:
- Kimi K2 via umans streams reasoning as plain content with only a bare `</think>`
  (no opening `<think>`) to mark the transition to real content.
- Extended `_split_thought_tags` to handle both `<thought>...</thought>` (Gemma-4)
  and `<think>...</think>` tag pairs, plus the bare-close-tag pattern.
- Extended `_extract_thought_tags_from_response` (non-streaming) with matching
  regex patterns and bare-close detection.

## 2026-06-22 — Fix: remove _model_has_implicit_thinking (double-handling bug)

Target: `feat(core): infrastructure improvements - latest aliases, error standardization, and utilities`
Files:
- `src/rotator_library/client/streaming.py`

Working commits before autosquash:
- `9811c72c fixup! feat(core): ...`

Verification:
- `uv run python3 -m py_compile src/rotator_library/client/streaming.py` — passed
- `uv run ruff check src/rotator_library/client/streaming.py --select F401,F811,F821,E9` — passed
- Live streaming test (umans/kimi-k2.6): content no longer misclassified as reasoning

Notes:
- Removed `_IMPLICIT_THINKING_MODELS` tuple and `_model_has_implicit_thinking()`.
- LiteLLM already handles `<think>` tag separation during streaming for providers
  that emit them. Starting `in_thought_block=True` caused double-handling where
  post-thinking content was suppressed as reasoning_content.
- The tag-based detection in `_split_thought_tags` remains for providers that emit
  tags but where LiteLLM does not strip them (e.g. `<thought>` from Gemma-4).
