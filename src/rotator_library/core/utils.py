    """
    Normalize usage fields so completion_tokens always includes reasoning_tokens.

    Some providers (e.g. Mistral) report reasoning_tokens as a separate count
    that is NOT included in completion_tokens ("exclusive reasoning"). The
    standard OpenAI convention expects reasoning_tokens to be a subset of
    completion_tokens ("inclusive reasoning"). Downstream consumers compute
    text_output = completion_tokens - reasoning_tokens, which produces
    negative values when the exclusive convention is used.

    This function detects the exclusive case (reasoning_tokens > completion_tokens)
    and normalizes to the inclusive convention by adding reasoning_tokens to
    completion_tokens and recalculating total_tokens. The internal tracking
    pipeline is unaffected — only the user-facing response is modified.

    Args:
        usage: Usage dict from a streamed chunk, or a pydantic/model usage
               object from a non-streamed response. Modified in-place.
        model: Model name for logging context.
